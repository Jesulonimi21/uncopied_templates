A single 3D letterform hosts six other forms, existing as a version and mutation of itself recontextualized in virtual space, inviting us to reexamine coded language as evolution and its consequences. The original forms were created in 2017 with a recurrent neural network fed with 50,000 world written languages to train the computer to remember to write languages other than Roman English over one million times, with intelligence to generate new letterforms. The new form operates as a memorial and preserved artifact of what the computer fails to remember, learn, and know under its bias architecture.",

Our algae biofuel-powered personal jets leave Los Angeles and New York times a day, 7 days a week. Slots are going fast, so call one of our licensed travel agents today! Swamp City: New Nature Begins Now. Swamp City imagines the Florida Everglades as a luxury eco-tourism retreat in a near-future reality of severe climate disruption. Featuring both human and non-human protagonists, including an anthropomorphic alligator refusing to migrate, an opportunistic celebrity architect, and a 3,500-year-old bald cypress tree resurrected with artificial intelligence, it explores the tensions between architecture, lifestyle capitalism, sentient technology, entangled ecologies, and a dying swamp.",

Using tactics of speculative fiction and working primarily through game engines and worldbuilding strategies, her current work explores interconnections of architecture, ecology, magic, and non-human and machine intelligences. Inspired by feminist science fiction authors such as Octavia E. Butler and Ursula K. Le Guin, she is interested in using emerging technologies including machine learning and artificial intelligence as well as video game design software to speculate on alternative interspecies survival strategies and envisioning more-than-human futures for our planet.

        "description": "In the 15th century, European countries embarked on expeditions to foreign territories in the search of new resources and wealth (including Christopher Columbus’ accidental arrival to America in 1492). These expeditions facilitated the establishment of Western European culture in other regions by exporting wealth, knowledge, and cultural goods, including the flora and fauna, from these ‘new worlds’. The objects, living organisms, and archives brought to these countries were used as the foundation to develop knowledge in Western Europe by displaying them as a symbols of imperial power. Contained within new public spaces such as botanical gardens, zoos, and natural history museums, these items served the public by reframing them as educational-recreational amusement. Since their inception, these venues have acted as a key factor to spread the notion of exoticism and otherness into the European subconscious. The cultural influence of these places remains relevant for science and society to this day. Since then, the use of new technologies have played a key role in facilitating the import of culture and living organisms from new territories. And as new technologies develop, expeditions are back in vogue. We are seeing an increasing rise in interest from European countries and the U.S.A. in researching and exploring new territories. Terra Incognita interrogates how these new worlds will be colonised in the 21st century.  \n\nCompacting visual glimpses of everything from Dr Robotnik’s hybridised techno-animals, to Amazon delivery crates unloading like buildings from Command & Conquer and literary references such as ‘Lord of the Flies’, ‘Animal Farm’ and Margaret Atwood’s ‘Oryx & Crake’, Juan Covelli’s Terra Incognita is a visual manifestation of colonial experimentation in the new world.",

Designed for licensed use in gaming or design platforms, the objects are inert props awaiting activation through merger with context and environment. \n \nThe conditions of the virtual REPLICANTS provide a generative shelter for artistic forms, liberating them from the burdens of corporeality, logistics, and limitations of conventional platforms to find agency in perpetuity. Ross-Ho approaches artistic production for the constructed logic of EPOCH as activity housed within this closed system, recontextualizing non-artisanal stock forms as existing instruments of currency to further circulate between these distinct platforms of virtual display and exchange.\n \nFor Untitled Syndrome (REPLICANTS), seven found iterations of the mask are presented at large scale, facing down, obscuring their identities and presenting their interior cavities. Now contextualized in space but remaining uncoupled with their intended subjects, this panoply of disguises maintain their vacancies in a permanent holding pattern. Within the logic of virtual simulation, the function of the mask is both evacuated and multiplied, effectively doubling down on artifice and the nested cloaking of identities in an endless moebius.",

As such, SOFT: Optics undermines the ideas of plutocratic self-determination and capital-as-power through its administration of dominance and submission on its possessor, subjecting them to stasis and immobility while forcing a compulsory gaze at their concealed possessions.
